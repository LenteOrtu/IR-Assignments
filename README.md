### IR-Assignment 1
Applied the Vector Space Model (VSM) for scoring using Lucene's ClassicSimilarity class.

### IR-Assignment 2
Tested the performance of the Okapi BM25 Probabilistic Retrieval Model and the LM Jelinek-Mercer model for different hyperparameter values.

### IR-Assignment 3
Implemented scoring using word embeddings. We trained models on the Retrieval System's documents and evaluated its performance, we also used pre-trained weights from a model trained on a Wikipedia dump. This phase was implemented both in Python and Java, with the Python implementation yielding
better results mainly due to the different tokenization methods used. 

### IR-Assignment 4
Combined different models using Lucene's class MultiSimilarity and evaluated the system's performance.
